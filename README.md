Creating a Python3 array based (weightless) neural network. The project will have a dataset of 600 4X3 pixelated, black and white images for characters either L or H, that we can represent as arrays that contains 1 for black pixel, 0 for white pixel. 400 of those images will be the training set, and 200 of those images will be the testing set.
